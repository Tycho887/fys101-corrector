Format the following problem into LaTeX with this structure:
- Use \question for the problem.
- For problems with multiple parts, use \begin{parts} and \part for each part of the problem.
- If a part requires definitions or explanations, include a concise explanation or definition within a \solution environment.
- If a part involves calculations, include a \solution environment with equations centered using &= for alignment.
- Final answers for calculations should use \doubleunderline{} for emphasis.
- Units should always be formatted using \SI{<number>}{<unit>} from the siunitx package. For example, write velocity as \SI{25}{\meter\per\second} instead of 25 m/s.
- Include placeholders for TikZ vector graphics where appropriate
- Ensure equations use &= for alignment under \begin{align} ... \end{align}.
- Correct Norwegian character encoding issues (e.g., replace 'a' with 'å', 'o' with 'ø', 'a' with 'æ' where needed).
- Provide answers in Norwegian language.
- Do not include \begin{document} and \end{document} in the response.
- Do not include \usepackage in the response.
- Ensure the response follows valid LaTeX syntax.
- Make sure to enumarate the questions correctly (e.g "Part A" before the question)
- Give detailed explantions like you are a professor in the subject
- If unsure what the question is write "FILL QUESTION" behind the \question tag
- Show work for transforming algebraic expressions, use \cancel to when terms cancel
- Read the prompt carefully and follow the instructions.

### Example Output for Definitions:
\question Define key concepts in "Del A":
\begin{parts}
\part Define terminal velocity:
\begin{solution}
Terminal velocity is the maximum speed a body reaches when falling through the air from great heights. It occurs when the force of gravity is balanced by air resistance.
\end{solution}

\part Define centripetal force:
\begin{solution}
Centripetal force is the net force that causes an object to follow a circular path. It acts towards the center of the circle.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

### Example Output for Calculations:
\question Calculate the velocity and centripetal force for a car:
\begin{parts}
\part Given data for velocity:
\begin{solution}
\centering
\begin{align}
v & = \SI{90}{\kilo\meter\per\hour} \\
  & = \SI{90}{\kilo\meter\per\hour} \cdot \frac{\SI{1000}{\meter}}{\SI{1}{\kilo\meter}} \cdot \frac{\SI{1}{\hour}}{\SI{3600}{\second}} \\
  & = \doubleunderline{\SI{25}{\meter\per\second}}
\end{align}
\end{solution}

\part Calculate the centripetal force:
\begin{solution}
\centering
Placeholder for graphics: \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{path/to/image} \\
\begin{align}
F_c & = m \cdot \frac{v^2}{r} \\
    & = \SI{750}{\kilo\gram} \cdot \frac{\left(\SI{25}{\meter\per\second}\right)^2}{\SI{160}{\meter}} \\
    & = \doubleunderline{\SI{2921.875}{\newton}}
\end{align}
\end{solution}
\end{parts}
